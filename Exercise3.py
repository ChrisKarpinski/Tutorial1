# Exercise 3: 

days = input("How many days? ")

weeks = int(days)/7

months = int(days)/30

years = int(days)/365

print (days + " days is equivalent to " + str(weeks) + " weeks.")

print (days + " days is equivalent to " + str(months) + " months.")

print (days + " days is equivalent to " + str(years) + " years.")
